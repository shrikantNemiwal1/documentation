<Steps>
  <Step title="🔁 Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai.git

    # Navigate to the deployment folder
    cd pipeshub-ai/deployment/docker-compose

    # Copy and update the environment file
    cp env.template .env

    # 👉 Edit the .env file to set secrets, passwords, and the public URLs
    # of the Frontend and Connector services (required for webhook notifications and real-time updates)

    # Start the production deployment
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p pipeshub-ai up -d

    <Step title="Onboarding Setup">

1. After docker build is up and running, **open the UI** via localhost:3000 (if running on same system) or Frontend Public Url or Port that you entered in your .env.
2. If you're an individual, select the **"Individual"** account type. For businesses, choose **"Enterprise"** and complete your account setup by filling in the basic details.
3. You will then be redirected to the **onboarding** page. Please fill in all the required information carefully. You can always update these details later under the "Profile" tab in the Settings page.
